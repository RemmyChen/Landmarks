The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to work with APIs (in this case, Google Maps), use XMLHttpRequest to retrieve data from a .json file on the server, parse through the data, and display the data on Google Maps.

I think the work has been correctly implemented as per the spec, though I'm not entirely sure if it's best to draw a simple polyline from me to the closest landmark. There are also multiple instances of the same people, which may be misleading just by looking at the map, and which obscures the icon marker for myself because it is overlapped with icon markers for others. I also have a lot of global variables and I didn't really modularize my script, I think the liberty in javascript makes me not super comfortable becausee I think what's happening feels a lot more obscure than if the language was more strict, so my script design can definitely be improved.

I didn't collaborate or discuss with anyone on the assignment and I spent around 7? 10? hours on the project. Thanks to https://stackoverflow.com/questions/14560999/using-the-haversine-formula-in-javascript for the Haversine distance function, thanks to Google Maps API documentation as well as Ming's examples files and in-class demonstrations for a lot of the code's implementation.
